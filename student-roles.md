# The role of the student

We often see higher education institutions and teachers talking about being 'student-centred' but I rarely see what they mean by this.

'Student-centred' sometimes feels like it lacks substance and any real impact.

For example, in the context of traditional higher education, student-centred cannot mean any of the following:

- The choice about whether to attend class.
- Adapting the timetable to better suit needs dictated by life circumstances.

What if generative AI enables a true student-centred approach to learning?

What if, instead of the teacher initiating the learning process (by choosing the learning outcomes, designing the curriculum, and so on), it's the student making those choices?

What if generative AI creates a learning context where the student role changes from a relatively passive recipient of a linear progression through a time-based, pre-determined curriculum, to an active and engaged driver of a personally meaningful learning pathway?
