# Roadmap for the project

## Newsletter

I want to build an [automated newsletter](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-create-an-automated-newsletter-for-free-7522c5646b50) where I can dump items of interest during the week, which get posted out to a mailing list automatically. I have no idea how to do this, other than suspecting it has something to do with [Github Actions](https://support.github.com/features/actions).

## Blog

I feel like the site needs a News section, where I can share progress updates on technical features that get included (for example, documenting the process of building a site like this), content updates, and so on. The process for creating a blogging feature in Jekyll seems faily well-documented, so it's likely that this will happen sooner than other features.

## Search

Because this site is built with a static site generator (i.e. no database or PHP...just plain HTML) there's no search function that's easy to integrate. Because I want this to be a dictionary as well as a programme of study, search is probably important to include. I have no idea how to do this.
