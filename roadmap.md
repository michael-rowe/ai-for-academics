# Roadmap for the project

## Content

Right now, there isn't much content on the site at all, as I'm focused on building out the infrastructure and functionality. For example, I'm working on updating the existing page metadata (i.e. page titles, descriptions, and tags). I'm also mostly adding content purely to see how it looks. Once I'm reasonably happy with the look of the pages, I'll create a template that can be applied to all pages so that any content I do add looks similar across the site. Once I'm happy with the general look and feel, I'll start adding information from my notes.

## Newsletter

I want to build an [automated newsletter](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-create-an-automated-newsletter-for-free-7522c5646b50) where I can dump items of interest during the week, which get posted out to a mailing list automatically. I have no idea how to do this, other than suspecting it has something to do with [Github Actions](https://support.github.com/features/actions).

## Blog

I feel like the site needs a News section, where I can share progress updates on technical features that get included (for example, documenting the process of building a site like this), content updates, and so on. The process for creating a blogging feature in Jekyll seems faily well-documented, so it's likely that this will happen sooner than other features.

## Search

Because this site is built with a static site generator (i.e. no database or PHP...just plain HTML) there's no search function that's easy to integrate. Because I want this to be a dictionary as well as a programme of study, search is probably important to include. I have no idea how to do this.
