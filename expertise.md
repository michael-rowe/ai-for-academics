# The democratisation of expertise

In the presentation below (Rowe, 2023b), I talk about the components that I see coming together to enable the development of universal 'anything' machines; customisable, contextually rich, personally aware characters, who are high-level experts in a wide range of disciplines, that you interact with through natural language.

In the presentation below (Rowe, 2023a) I discuss the idea that large language models are the embodiment of diverse expertise that is widely available, and the implications of this on health professions education ([download slides](./media/Rowe%20(2023)%20AI%20and%20expertise%20in%20professional%20education.pdf).)

Here is a short summary of the presentation, generated by Claude.

The presentation argues that generative AI like ChatGPT provides increasing access to expertise, threatening the privileged role of universities as gatekeepers of professional knowledge. As AI becomes more competent at applying knowledge to solve problems and communicate complex ideas effectively, it essentially serves as an expert mentor. This “expertise on demand” enables personalised, contextualised, and low-cost learning independent of formal degree programs.

The presentation acknowledges common criticisms of AI like bias and inaccuracy, but argues AI is improving on these fronts and has advantages over humans. It envisions AI becoming embedded in all types of software and platforms, providing intelligence wherever needed.

Whereas universities historically controlled access to professional expertise needed for many careers, AI democratises expertise, allowing anyone to learn from a personalised disciplinary expert, teacher, mentor, etc. New education approaches will emerge that emphasize AI-assistance, project-based learning, and authentic assessments. The availability and integration of AI expertise means universities no longer have a monopoly on accredited learning – cheaper alternatives can arise.

The presenter argues we should raise expectations for what’s possible in education now that learners can partner with advanced AI. Rather than just using it to write essays, it can enable personalised businesses, community projects, marketing campaigns, products, and more. The implications are that formal professional education may soon look very different in a world where expertise is abundantly available to all from AI.
