This is a site that I'm putting together to guide my own learning about generative AI in the context of health professions education.

Over the past year or so, I've kept up to date with the accelerating progression of generative AI development in a haphazard and ad hoc fashion. I subscribe to newsletters, blog posts, YouTube channels, podcasts, and academic journals, mostly just consuming whatever happens to be included in the deluge that comes my way. In 2024 I want to take a more intentional approach to my learning about generative.

So I've put together a curriculum for myself. This site is the framework for that curriculum, which I'll update as I work through my notes.

And I figured I might as well do all the work in public, just in case it's useful for someone else.

Find out more about the [background to the project here](./about.md).
