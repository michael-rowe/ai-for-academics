This is a course that I'm putting together to guide my own learning about generative AI in the context of health professions education. I figured I might as well do all the work in public, as it might also be useful for someone else.

This is not about exploring the cutting edge of generative AI; it's about exploring the kind of generative AI that's available for everyone. Which means that I'm only going to talk about open-source language models, and open-access content.

Find out more about the [background here](./about.md).
