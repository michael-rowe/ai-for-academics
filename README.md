# Artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education
A free, open-access programme of study on AI in higher education.

There are many resources you can use to learn about artificial intelligence (AI) in a wide range of contexts but few that present the relevant information in an accessible format. The aim of this course is to provide a programme of study for academics in a higher education context, who are interested in the topic of AI.

What makes this course different is the focus on open-access content, and open-source language models. This is not about exploring the cutting edge of generative AI; this course is about exploring the kind of generative AI that's available for everyone.
