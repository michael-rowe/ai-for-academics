This is a site[^2] I'm putting together to guide my own learning about generative AI in the context of health professions education.

Over the past year or so, I've kept up to date with the accelerating progression of generative AI development in a haphazard and ad hoc fashion. I subscribe to newsletters, blog posts, YouTube channels, podcasts, and academic journals, mostly just consuming whatever happens to be included in the deluge that comes my way. In 2024 I want to take a more intentional approach to my learning about generative AI.

So I've put together a curriculum for myself. This site is the framework for that curriculum, which I'll update as I work through my notes.

And I figured I might as well do all the work in public, just in case it's useful for someone else.

**Background**

- Before you start, you may want to check out these suggestions on [how to use this resource](./how.md).
- If you're feeling feisty, find out how to [participate](./participate.md).
- Find out more about the [background to the project here](./about.md).
- [Roadmap for the project](./roadmap.md).
- Submit an [issue here](https://github.com/michael-rowe/ai-in-hpe/issues). Issues can be errors, broken links, suggestions, disagreements, and so on.
- [Project updates](./blog.md).
- [Contact me](./contact.md). If you want to. No pressure.

**Table of Contents**[^3]

*Note that most of these pages are currently blank. They'll fill up over time, as I work through my notes and resources. This is a framework that will guide my learning and over time will become a resource for anyone. Right now it's nothing but a collection of links.*

[^1]: Unsurprisingly, this is just like you get with a language model.
[^2]: I'm not sure what exactly this resource is going to be. It may be a phased approach where it starts as something more like a dictionary of terms, then becomes a wiki, and maybe progressing to an online course.
[^3]: This will almost certainly not be the structure for very long. I'm experimenting with different organisation principles for the content and this category-type approach isn't very satisfying for a learning resource.
