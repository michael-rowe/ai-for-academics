This is a site[^2] I'm putting together to guide my own learning about generative AI in the context of health professions education. Use the **TOC link** in the menu above to get to the site content.

Over the past year or so, I've kept up to date with the accelerating progression of generative AI development in a haphazard and ad hoc fashion. I subscribe to newsletters, blog posts, YouTube channels, podcasts, and academic journals, mostly just consuming whatever happens to be included in the deluge that comes my way. In 2024 I want to take a more intentional approach to my learning about generative AI.

So I've put together a curriculum for myself. This site is the framework for that curriculum, which I'll update as I work through my notes.

And I figured I might as well do all the work in public, just in case it's useful for someone else.

**Background**

- Before you start, you may want to check out these suggestions on [how to use this resource](./how.md).
- If you're feeling feisty, find out how to [participate](./participate.md).
- [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) for the project.

[^2]: I'm not sure what exactly this resource is going to be. It may be a phased approach where it starts as something more like a dictionary of terms, then becomes a wiki, and maybe progressing to an online course.
