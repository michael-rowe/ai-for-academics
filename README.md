There are many resources you can use to learn about generative artificial intelligence (AI) in a wide range of contexts, but few that present the most relevant information in an accessible format. The aim of this resource is to provide a programme of study for anyone interested in the topic of generative AI in the context of higher education.

There are a few things that make this resource different to others: Open-access content, and emphasis on open-source language models. 

This is not about exploring the cutting edge of generative AI; this course is about exploring the kind of generative AI that's available for everyone.

*Why do I think this matters?*

> Because open source and open access are the only way to ensure that this technology is available for everyone who needs it.
