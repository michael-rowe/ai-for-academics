# Generative AI in curriculum design

Most of what I've read about using gAI in the curriculum has focused on one of two perspectives:

- Lecturers using gAI to create content and redesign assessment tasks.
- Students using gAI as a tutor, or students using gAI to cheat.

I wanted to explore what it might look like if we thought of gAI in the context of interprofessional education (IPE), where gAI acts as another member of the healthcare team.
