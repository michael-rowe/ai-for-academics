*Human-AI collaboration* is when you and the AI work in harmony to create something that would be harder to do if each was working independently.

Artificial intelligence offers transformative potential for improving health professions education (HPE), yet also raises complex ethical and practical questions. The discourse often falls into false dichotomies, positioning AI as either our saviour or an existential threat, oversimplifying the complexity of human values. By exploring the intertwined themes of ethics, moral uncertainty, and the evolving role of human beings, this presentation aims to shed light on the importance of embracing ambiguity and fostering human-machine coalitions for ethical advancements in AI-supported HPE.

Drawing inspiration from the antihero archetype, we will explore the complexities of AI's integration into teaching and research, taking care not to oversimplify its risks, nor idealise its capabilities. AI is not a hero or villain, but is rather an ambiguous character in novel human-machine partnerships that combine the strengths of human judgement and data-driven insights. The interface between technology and humanity allows us to experiment with the uncertainty of AI, enabling us to move beyond the reductive idea of AI as a *deus ex machina* that functions as a neat resolution to our concerns.

Ultimately, wise adoption of AI is no panacea, but rather the beginning of an iterative, cooperative process of aligning cutting-edge technologies with humanistic values. This presentation aims to encourage dialogue among students, educators, researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in navigating the ethical dimensions of AI in practice. By embracing the potential of AI while also upholding human values, we can start building a future where human-machine coalitions drive transformative advancements in HPE.
