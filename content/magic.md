# Generative AI is a kind of magic

Magic may be so appealing because magic gives people agency and power, and people are typically powerless.

If magic empowers you to reach further than you thought was possible, then generative AI may be a kind of magic.

I also love thinking about prompts, especially structured prompts, as a kind of spellbook or grimoire, as Ethan Mollick explains:

> ...companies can develop useful prompts that do serious work and capture them in corporate grimoires, prompt libraries that encode the expertise of their best practices into forms that anyone can use ([Ethan Mollick, 2023](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/now-is-the-time-for-grimoires))
