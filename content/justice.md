# Justice

Justice, or fairness, has come up in discussions around the integration of AI in HPE.

I'm not entirely sure how the question even makes sense. For one thing, just and fair for who?

I suppose it may be a useful question to keep in mind if we want to ensure that institutions are providing equal access to all students.

However, just like our current system doesn't prevent inequality of access (some students live closer to campus, have better devices, unlimited access, and don't need to work, for example), this question isn't going to be addressed through regulation.

You might argue that teachers who integrate generative AI into assessment will specify which language models are allowed to be used, and those will likely be the ones licensed by the institution. However, there's nothing stopping students from personally paying for access to better models. Just like there's nothing stopping students today from paying for tutors, better resources, and so on.

Whether we like it or not, our existing system isn't just or fair, and it bothers me a little to impose this requirement on AI systems, when we don't give it a second thought elsewhere.
