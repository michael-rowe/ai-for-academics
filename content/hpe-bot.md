[HPE-Bot](https://hpe-bot.com/) is a "Health Professions AI Tutor for students of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and allied health."

It's a customised [GPT](gpt-custom.md) developed by Stephen Coetzee and Lambert Schuwirth, with an emphasis on using generative AI to support health professions education.

There are free and commercial tiers for the service, with additional support being integrated into the paid service.

While the cost of the platform is reasonable (about $3.33 / month when you pay for an annual subscription), given the costs of using [GPT-4](gpt-openai.md##GPT-4)

*Note: I will soon be publishing a conversation with the developer of HPE-Bot, on the In Beta podcast.*
