# Sustainability of generative AI

We can start by agreeing that the energy requirements for developing and running large language models are significant.

However, I believe the problem is more complicated than most people appreciate, for the following reasons:

- Articles and blog posts focusing on the issue tend to have an outcome in mind, and then present information in a way that moves the reader in that direction i.e. they're not neutral.
- AI is also being used to develop solutions to the climate crisis.
- Most of the energy used is during the training phase i.e. we've already 'spent' that energy. Limiting the use of generative AI isn't going to bring it back.
- If generative AI leads to an abundance of human flourishing through improved education, creativity, and commercial opportunities, would it be worth the impact on the climate?
- What if the continued use of generative AI helped reduce the impact of climate change wrought by industrial age technologies?

I'm going to try and explore this topic in some depth in this section.

## Energy consumption

> There are sustainability challenges posed by the intensive energy and water costs involved in training and operating generative AI systems. The graphics process units (GPU) chips on which these models run require 10-15 times the energy of a traditional CPU with significant water use in cooling the servers. This has been described as the ‘dirty secret’ of the current hype wave with what Timnit Gebru has called the “corporate pissing contest” of ever larger models leading to spiralling ecological impacts. - [Mark Carrigan](https://markcarrigan.net/2023/11/01/generative-ai-in-higher-education-what-comes-after-the-assessment-crisis/)
### Stranded energy

I don't know if this is true for AI but Bitcoin mining can be made to use 'stranded' energy i.e. energy that can't easily put to productive use elsewhere.

> Unlike other industries, Bitcoin mining is relatively mobile. In their quest for cheap and abundant energy sources, miners can set up new facilities fairly quickly all over the world, including the most remote areas. As a result, Bitcoin miners can tap into so-called ‘stranded’ energy assets that cannot easily be put to productive use by other industries. In those cases, Bitcoin miners are not competing with other industries or residential users for the same resources, but instead soaking up surplus energy *that would otherwise have been lost or wasted*. - https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/comparisons

## Water consumption


## AI as part of the solution

Microsoft has started training AI to [generate the paperwork](https://the-decoder.com/microsoft-uses-ai-to-speed-up-small-nuclear-reactor-approvals-for-ai-training-data-centers/) necessary for regulatory approval of next-generation nuclear reactors[^1] that that will power data centres. The time taken to bring this technology online might be significantly reduced through the use of AI in the process, helping organisations move away from fossil fuel power.
