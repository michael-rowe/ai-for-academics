# Teacher identity in the context of generative AI

There's going to be a lot about the changing or evolving role of teacher identity in the context of generative AI.

I wonder if it's going to be more of a *return* to an identity we've lost.

I've heard people ask if this is really how we want to teach. I'd flip that question around and ask instead, **"Is this how we enable more people to learn?"**
