# Creating a classroom AI policy to guide the use of generative AI

I wanted students in my module to feel confident and supported in their use of generative AI and the [institutional policy](./institutional-AI-policy.md) wasn't creating that supportive context that they needed.

So I created a classroom AI policy for use by students in my module.

I don't believe that using generative AI is relevant or even appropriate for all modules or programmes; I'm not suggesting that you _should_ use this in your classroom. However, if you are considering, or have already started, introducing generative AI into your lessons, it would be useful to prepare a policy document that will establish the context for using AI in your classroom. And to make it clear that the policy applies _only_ to your classroom.

This draft is based on _Mollick, E. (2023)._ [_Why all our classes suddenly became AI classes_](https://www.hbsp.harvard.edu/inspiring-minds/why-all-our-classes-suddenly-became-ai-classes)_. Harvard Business Publishing Education_.
