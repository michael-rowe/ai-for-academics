# Developing AI literacy

Developing AI literacy is a increasingly considered a key skill for all stakeholders in health professions education.

Here is a framework for developing AI literacy (Allen & Kendeou, 2023):

- Knowledge: Understand how AI works and its principles.
- Evaluation: Critically judge AI's strengths, limitations, and biases.
- Collaboration: Communicate and collaborate effectively with AI systems and people.
- Contextualisation: Use AI as a tool in real-world settings.
- Autonomy: Make independent decisions while interacting with AI.
- Ethics: Address moral issues like fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy.

The PAIR framework (Acar, 2023) is another option to consider when developing AI literacy (there are many frameworks but this is one that appeals to me).

> The PAIR (Problem, AI, Interaction, Reflection) framework emerges from a motivation to proactively integrate AI into our curricula. Specifically, PAIR aims to cultivate five essential skills that are paramount for leveraging these technologies responsibly: problem formulation, exploration, experimentation, critical thinking, and reflection.

1. Problem formulation: define the problem or challenge you aim to address with generative AI. Identify the core problem, its components and constraints
2. AI tool selection: identify and choose the most suitable generative AI tools to address the problem, a process which should involve exploring, comparing, and evaluating the features of various generative AI options.
3. Interaction: deploy the generative AI tools on the problem, experimenting with diverse inputs and critically evaluating the outputs. Experiment with different ways to interact; critically evaluate outputs and integrate them to tackle the problem
4. Reflection: Evaluate how the AI tool helped or hindered problem-solving; reflect on your feelings when collaborating with AI; assess and report on the experience with the generative AI tools.
