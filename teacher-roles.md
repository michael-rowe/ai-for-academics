# Teacher identity in the context of generative AI

I've heard people ask if this is really how we want to teach. I'd flip that question around and ask instead, **"Is this how we enable more people to learn, and to learn better?"**

One thing that's clear from the online courses I've completed on the topic, is that they maintain that the teacher is the centre of the learning process, and therefore assume that the teacher matters more than I think they do. This is something that should be contested, given that generative AI enables an approach to learning that, in many cases, routes around the teacher.

When we have society-wide access to expertise, why would someone go to a teacher? What do we offer when students can access [[universal teachers]](see [[Are We on the Verge of Having a 'Universal Teacher']]) that are effectively free?

There's going to be a lot about the changing or evolving role of teacher identity in the context of generative AI.

I wonder if it's going to be more of a *return* to an identity we've lost.
