## Learning theory and gAI

Learning theories in digital contexts e.g. social constructivism, connectivism, critical pedagogy, situated cognition.

What is the relationship between gAI and learning theory?

One of the most exciting opportunities I see is the ability to integrate learning theory into the generative AI itself, either through [structured prompts](<prompting.md#Structured prompting>) or GPTs.

### Learning theory and prompts

As part of the prompt, you could tell the language model to ensure that it's outputs are aligned with specific theories of learning.

**Example**

```
You are an expert educator with 10 years of experience. You are especially skilled at creating student-centred assignments that are aligned with a critical pedagogy. Draft an outline of an assignment on the topic of ethics in clinical practice, bearing in mind that the students have only had a few months of supervised practice in the clinical context.
```

### Social constructivism

One of the premises of social constructivism is that learning is personally meaningful, and that new knowledge is anchored to existing knowledge. Structured prompts mean that you can set up the language model to ask students what is important to them, so that it can relate the content it generates to that personal context.
