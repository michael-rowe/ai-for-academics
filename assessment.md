# Generative AI in assessment

In the presentation below ([download slides](./media/Rowe%20(2023)%20-%20CPUT%20-%20Generative%20AI%20and%20assessment.pdf)), I start with some operational assumptions around assessment that inform my thinking. I then talk about how large language models are different to other types of technology that influence assessment practices. I describe the standard assessment paradigm, and the negative impact of working within this paradigm (this is when the recording begins), and then talk about how AI-supported assessment may move us into a different assessment paradigm.

I talk about some of the recent changes to large language models and how these changes move us towards what I've previously called 'universal anything machines' (see [expertise](./expertise.md)). I go on to discuss principles of assessment design with specific reference to platforms like ChatGPT, and then work through an example of an assessment task making explicit use of ChatGPT.

Finally, I briefly describe a faculty development framework, as well as the implications of AI-supported assessment on the academy, and on learning more broadly.

> This was a wide-ranging conversation that explored some of the detail around how language models work, it’s inability to compare responses to valid models of the world, practical uses for AI in teaching, learning, and assessment, and the risks of having AI being trained on data generated by AI. We explore the implications of a higher education system that embraces AI, and ask if integrating AI has inherent value, or if it’s value is simply instrumental. And we discuss an awkward conclusion that at least of us feels is inevitable (Ellis & Rowe, 2023).
