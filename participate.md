# Participation

One of the reasons I wanted to use Github Pages to host this site is because it's linked to Github, which has a few features that might make for an interesting project:

- Anyone can fork this project and create their own version.
- Anyone can raise issues that are entered into a workflow.
- Anyone can edit the content in a way that's fully version-controlled.

Now, just because these features are available, it doesn't mean it's easy. There's a learning curve but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

At the moment, there are limited ways to contribute to the project.

1. Share the link on the Interwebs.
2. [Create an issue](https://github.com/michael-rowe/ai-in-hpe/issues) on Github.
3. [Create a Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/creating-an-account-on-github) and ask me for an invitation to collaborate (more about this process [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository)).
