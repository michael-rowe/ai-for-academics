# Participation

One of the reasons I wanted to use Github Pages to host this site is because it's linked to Github, which has a few features that might make for an interesting project:

- Anyone can fork this project and create their own version.
- Anyone can raise issues that are entered into a workflow.
- Anyone can edit the content in a way that's fully version-controlled.

Now, just because these features are available, doesn't mean it's easy. There's a learning curve but I don't see this as a bad thing...
