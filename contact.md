# Contact me

For now, you can contact me by email at <a href="mailto:mrowedr@gmail.com">mrowedr@gmail.com</a>.

Alternatively, you can use the [contact form](https://www.mrowe.co.za/blog/contact/) on my personal site.

Or you can use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-rowe-0a6b814/), although I don't spend much time there.

If you want to tell me about something wrong with the site (a broken link, missing content, empty pages, and so on), you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/michael-rowe/ai-in-hpe/issues).

I'm working on adding a contact form to this site but it's a bit more complicated than adding a shortcode.
