# How to use this resources

## Simple

The Table of Contents are an attempt to provide a structured progression through a series of concepts. Think of it as the development of an argument, with premises building up over time.

Of course, a topic as broad, complex and multifaceted as 'generative AI in health professions education' is unlikely to permit a simplistic, linear progression through a series of logical stages.

Which is why the course is also designed as a network.

## Intermediate

Each major concept in the topic is part of a networked ecosystem where you can meander through it in any direction that takes your fancy. Choose a topic from the Table of Contents, and see where it takes you.

## Advanced

It you're feeling feisty, you can clone the Github repository and create a local version of the course that you can not only edit for yourself, but where you can contribute your edits back to the main branch of the course.

## Learning assistant

I'm not ready for this yet, but at some point, I'd like to create a GPT of this course, where you can interact with the course content through a language model. In other words, to use generative AI to learn about using using generative AI.
