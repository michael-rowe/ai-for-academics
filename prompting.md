# Prompting LLMs

**Aim**

**Objectives**
- To define *prompting* in the context of gAI.
- To experiment with different types of prompts.

---

Many people approach prompting like they approach internet search. They provide a few keywords and expect 'the answer'. This is the wrong way to think about prompting lanugage models.

Approach language model prompting as if you were having a conversation with a person.

## What is a *prompt*?

At the surface level, a prompt is the text (or image) you provide to the language model that initiates your interaction.

At a deeper level, the prompt establishes the context for the interaction.

## Structure of a prompt

A useful way to think about structuring prompts is:

- Role: Give the language model a persona where you tell it what it is good at.
- Goal: Explain what outcome you're looking for.
- Instruct: Tell the language model what you want it to do.

Another framework is CIDI:

- Context: 
- Instructions: 
- Details: 
- Input: 

**Example**

```
You are an ICU nurse with 20 years of experience. etc.
```
