# Project update

I've slowly been adding and updating content across the site, with some pages getting significant updates, and new pages being created. Some of those new pages aren't in the Table of Contents though, making them hard to discover.

The nature of building the site in this way (i.e. by adding and editing text files on my local machine, and then uploading them via Git) means that I'm trading off the ease with which I can add new information to the site, against enforced structure that makes navigation easier.

I'm OK with that.

I'm really enjoying the process of using my notes from what I'm learning, to build this site. It's still very early days and most of what I've been adding isn't yet contextualised for the health professions education context, but that will come in time.
