# Creative Commons CC BY-SA license added

I've added a [Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1) to all pages on this site.

> This license requires that reusers give credit to the creator. It allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, even for commercial purposes. If others remix, adapt, or build upon the material, they must license the modified material under identical terms.

This means that you are free to:

- **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.
- **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.

Under the following terms:

- Attribution — You must give appropriate credit , provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made . You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
- No additional restrictions — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.
