# Creative Commons CC BY-SA license added

I've added a [Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1) to all pages on this site.

I wanted to make sure that it's clear that anyone can take any part of the content and reproduce it for any purpose. There's a bit of overlap between what I think of as the open-access part of the site (which is what this license covers) and the open-source part of the project (which is covered in the Github license). At some point I'll write something about the difference to make sure that I understand it correctly.

Back to the site content and this CC license.

> This license requires that reusers give credit to the creator. It allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, even for commercial purposes. If others remix, adapt, or build upon the material, they must license the modified material under identical terms.

This means that you are free to:

- **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.
- **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow these license terms:

- **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit , provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made . You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
- **ShareAlike** — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
- **No additional restrictions** — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.
