So the news section of the site is up and running. It was easier than I thought it would be.

I've had lots of experience with WordPress and Blogger blogs but those kinds of content management systems are typically easy to set up and don't require any understanding of how they work. They're also database-driven and this site doesn't have a database (see *[static site generators](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Static_site_generator)*).
