I used the Jekyll *sitemap* plugin to build the [sitemap](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sitemap), which was much easier than I thought it would be. A sitemap increases a site's visibility for search engines:

> For use by search engines and other crawlers, there is a structured format, the XML Sitemap, which lists the pages in a site, their relative importance, and how often they are updated. This is pointed to from the robots.txt file and is typically called sitemap.xml.

I also added the relevant .html file to the site to verify that I own the site. In this context, *ownership* means that I have full admin access to the root folder. It means that Google can give me advanced permissions in [Google Console](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en).

> Site owners in Search Console have access to sensitive Google Search information about a site. Site owners can also perform actions that can affect a site's presence and behavior on Google Search and other Google services. Because of this, we want to make sure that only a real site owner is granted owner permissions on Search Console.

This is part of the process of ensuring that the site gets correctly indexed by Google and other search engines.
