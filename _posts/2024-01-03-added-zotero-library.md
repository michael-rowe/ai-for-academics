# Zotero group library added

I've created a public group library in Zotero, which is where I'll be working with the academic resources I collect for this project.

The plan is to create an annotated bibliography of sorts, which will be accessible to anyone interested in the topic. Note that the actual PDFs won't be available to download from the library; not because of copyright concerns but rather because the storage capacity for group libraries in Zotero comes at a cost.

You can access all the metadata, including any annotations and notes I take.

And you can export citation information, as well as a bibliography of the entire library.
