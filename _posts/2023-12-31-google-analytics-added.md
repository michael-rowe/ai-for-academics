# Added Google Analytics

I wanted to find an open-source version of Google Analytics that I could use to find out if the site it useful for others. I plan on going quite deep on some of the technical aspects of generative AI (and other types of artificial intelligence) and I guess I'm interested to know what others find useful. In this context, I'm assuming that visiting certain pages on the site is a measure of interest, and that that interest is tied to possible utility.

[Offen](https://www.offen.dev/) looks like a good option but you need to run it on your own server i.e. it's not cloud-based like Google Analytics. But because of how static sites work you can't include any server-side activity, which means that I'd need to host the software somewhere else, where the analytics could actually be captured and conducted.

So, for now, I've gone with Google Analytics. It's not my ideal choice but it's a reasonable trade-off in terms of being a balance between convenience, cost, and philosophy.
