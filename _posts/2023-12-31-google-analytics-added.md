# Added Google Analytics

I wanted to find an open-source version of Google Analytics that I could use to find out if the site is useful for others. I'm assuming that if people visit it, it might be useful.

[Offen](https://www.offen.dev/) looks like a good option but you need to run it on your own server i.e. it's not cloud-based like Google Analytics. But because of how static sites work you can't include any server-side activity, which means that I'd need to host the software somewhere else, where the analytics could actually be captured and conducted.

So, for now, I've gone with Google Analytics. It's not my ideal choice but it's a reasonable trade-off in terms of being a balance between convenience, cost, and philosophy.
