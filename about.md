# About

## Rationale for the project
I've been conscious of the fact that most of what I've learned about generative AI has been haphazard and ad hoc. Basically, whatever shows up in my feed (blog posts, podcasts, Twitter, etc) is what I've paid attention to. While I have spent time building that feed, I haven't had any direction or goals that would help to make my exploration and learning more intentional.

So, starting early in 2024, I put together a programme of study that would provide a framework for what I learned, making it more structured and guided.

## Process
This is the process whereby information moves from The World into this site:
1. Something arrives in my feed that looks interesting.
2. I save it into Reader with appropriate tags to find later.
3. I read and annotate it with tags and notes.
4. Those annotations get imported into Obsidian.
5. I read the annotations and sometimes convert them into blog posts, permanent notes, course content, etc.
6. And that's where it used to end. Now, there's another step: move the most important information (IMO) to this site.

**What the site is not:**

- A collection of filtered content.
- A dump of information.
- An uncritical praising of all things AI.

## Technology choices
I considered creating a section of my blog ([/usr/space](https://www.mrowe.co.za/blog/)) to capture what I was learning but I worried that I'd be spending a lot of time messing around with the CMS part of a website. I do most of my writing in Obsidian and thought it would be a hassle to move content from there to WordPress.

I've been wanting to learn more about *static site generators* for a while, after having come across them in 2023 while thinking about another project, but haven't had an excuse to figure out how they work. And I've also wanted to explore [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a free option for publishing my notes (I wasn't going to pay for Obsidian Publish).

Choosing to create the site in Github Pages also means that it's possible for anyone to contribute. Since this is about making sense of generative AI in health professions education, I thought it'd be useful if it wasn't just my opinions (and biases) that get included in the project.
