# Agency in learning

It's true that for now, a human needs to start the learning process. AI in itself has no motivation to start anything.

It has no goals and no objectives.

The point has been made that a human (when teachers make this argument, a 'teacher') needs to start the process.

But this often misses the point that the human with the agency and motivation to initiate the learning journey could (should?) be a student.

For example, we've seen the discussion where teachers are exploring the ethics of using AI to create course outlines, outcomes, content, and assessment. But, I haven't seen anyone debating the ethics of students using AI to create course outlines, outcomes, content, and assessment. I haven't seen any serious discussion about what the world looks like when students truly take control of their own learning.

And let's be clear, they're not going to ask for permission.

The question often seems to come back to, "Is this how we want to teach?" I don't think this is the right question. The right question is, "What if this is how we enable more people to learn?"
